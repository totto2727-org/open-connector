Caution when the result is fed to create_message: if the identifier is mistyped but still resolves to another real user this account already has a DM with, this action succeeds and returns that person's space, and the returned space id is opaque, so it cannot be eyeballed to confirm the recipient. The result therefore carries peer, the person the space actually belongs to, named by Google Chat or the Workspace directory: read it back to the user and confirm the name before sending. Nothing enforces that check. Naming the peer needs the chat.memberships.readonly and directory.readonly scopes plus the People API on top of the scope below.
