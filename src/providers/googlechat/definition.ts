/**
 * Google Chat provider backed by the Chat API and a user-provided Google OAuth app.
 *
 * An OAuth connection requests space and message history reads, space membership
 * reads (chat.memberships.readonly, to find a direct message's other participant),
 * Workspace directory profile reads (directory.readonly, used through the People
 * API to name members and senders), and plain-text message creation, which is
 * what the Chat API supports under user authentication. Message creation uses the
 * Sensitive-tier chat.messages.create scope rather than the Restricted-tier
 * chat.messages, so update, delete, and reaction access is never requested.
 * Service account tokens stay on the space and message read scopes, so sending
 * and naming need an OAuth user connection.
