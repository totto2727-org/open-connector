/**
 * The scopes a user OAuth authorization may request — the menu, not a minimum.
 *
 * `gmail.readonly` is here and not in {@link gmailOAuthScopes} because the two
 * lists answer different questions. That one asks "what does a service account
 * token need to cover every action"; `modify` subsumes `readonly` there, so
 * adding it would be redundant at best and, through domain-wide delegation,
 * breaking at worst.
 *
 * This one is what `filterDeclaredScopes` intersects a caller's
 * `requestedScopes` against, so a scope absent here cannot be requested AT ALL.
 * Leaving `readonly` out therefore forced every read-only integration to
 * authorize `gmail.modify` — write, label and trash on the user's mailbox — in
 * order to call actions that declare `gmailReadScopes`. That is the opposite of
 * least privilege, and it is invisible: consent succeeds, so nothing reports
 * that more was granted than the integration can use.
 *
 * Note for anyone storing a client config WITHOUT `requestedScopes`:
 * `getEffectiveScopes` falls back to this whole list, so such a config now asks
 * for four scopes rather than three. `readonly` is subsumed by `modify`, so no
 * new capability is granted — but the consent screen gains a line, and a
 * deployment that wants the narrow set should say so explicitly with
 * `requestedScopes`, which is the correct posture regardless.
